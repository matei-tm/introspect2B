## Future Roadmap (Concise)

1. Add model fallback and A/B routing (Nova Lite/other Bedrock models).
2. Add canary deployment strategy in CodePipeline for safer releases.
3. Expand compliance controls (data retention policy, key management, audit packaging).
4. Add SLO-based alerting tied to API and summarization latency objectives.
